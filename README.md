## Hello Sezzle! ðŸ”¥

The gist of this calculator...

1. Calculations entered into input field
2. Calculations sent through websocket to server
3. The server then...
   a. parsers the calculation
   b. solves it
   c. adds a timestamp (to get the last X number of calculations)
   d. sends in back down the wire to the client

#### Bonus ðŸŽ‰

This is me, my wife, and our 2 cats trying to ignore us. This is the only picture in existence of the 4 of us. Behold.
